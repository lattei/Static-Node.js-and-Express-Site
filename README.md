# Static Node.js and Express Site
 Treehouse TechDegree Unit 6 Project

Created a static portfolio of the projects I've done so far with Team Treehouse.

To run this, just run npm start.

Style Changes I've made:

Projects Box Text Color (H5) changed from #0a0a0a, to #4865bd;
General Text Font (h5) changed to Times New Roman rather than Lato.
Sidebar Text Color changed to white #fbf6f6;
Border Style Double given to my profile picture
Added a Text Shadow to my header.
Removed bottom border from homepage p elements.
