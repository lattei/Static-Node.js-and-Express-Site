    h1 Hi, I'm Carline and welcome to my crib!

    //- Replace with a description for your portfolio, what this project is, it's purpose, what it's supposed to accomplish, etc. 
    p As a cyber citizen since Y2K, I have finally decided to embark on my journey to become a full fledged software engineer. It's been decades in the making.
    p Armed with the tools I've learned from self-study, Ada Developers Academy, AnitaB.org, Team Treehouse and Intuit, I aim to become the ultimate team player to any software development team. Put me in, coach!
    p Here are the current projects I've worked on during my TechDegree journey with Team Treehouse. If you want to check out my previous work from Ada Developers Academy, click here.

      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file  
        something similar like
        ul 
          each project in projects
            .cell
              a(href='#')
                img.thumbnail(src='https://placehold.it/550x550', alt='')
                h5 My Site
        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:
          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text

        .cell
          a(href='#')
